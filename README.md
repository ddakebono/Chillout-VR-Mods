### No Discord RPC :closed_lock_with_key: 
Disables CVR's custom Discord RPC as soon as it initializes.

---

### QM Freeze :stop_button: 
Disables the local players movement system when either of the menu's are opened. Allowing you to open and control your menu while falling.
This keeps you completely still in air whenever any menu is open.

Yes i'm aware a similar mod has been created for BepinEx by 'xKiraiChan', but i didn't find out about this till i'd finished this mod.

### No Mirrors :mirror: 

Instantly deletes all mirrors the second they try to be rendered. This may help with performance or just be a preference.
